def validate(problem, solution):
    '''
    Return true if `solution` is a valid plan for `problem`.
    Otherwise, return false.

    OBSERVATION: you should check action applicability,
    next-state generation and if final state is indeed a goal state.
    It should give you some indication of the correctness of your planner,
    mainly for debugging purposes.
